# RxAndroid-Sample
A sample app I created for the talk I gave at the Utah County Android Developers group meetup on 2.12.15 at MokiMobility

Updated for an RxJava presentation I gave at my workplace, Vivint, on October 21 2015.

[Slides](https://github.com/dustin-graham/RxAndroid-Sample/blob/master/RxJava%20Vivint%20Presentation.key) are included in the repo.
